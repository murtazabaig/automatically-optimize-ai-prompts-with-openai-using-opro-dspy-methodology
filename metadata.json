  "description": "This workflow implements cutting-edge concepts from Google DeepMind's OPRO(Optimization by PROmpting) and Stanford's DSPy to automatically refine AIprompts. It iteratively generates, evaluates, and optimizes responses against aground truth, allowing you to \"compile\" your prompts for maximum accuracy.WHY THIS IS POWERFULInstead of manually tweaking prompts (trial and error), this workflow treatsprompt engineering as an optimization problem: * OPRO-style Optimization: The \"Optimizer\" LLM analyzes past performance scores and reasons to mathematically deduce a better prompt. * DSPy-style Logic: It separates the \"Logic\" (Workflow) from the \"Parameters\" (Prompts), allowing the system to self-correct until it matches the Ground Truth.HOW IT WORKS * Define: Set your initial prompt and a test case with the expected answer (Ground Truth). * Generate: The workflow generates a response using the current prompt. * Evaluate: An AI Evaluator scores the response (0-100) based on accuracy and format. * Optimize: If the score is low, the Optimizer AI analyzes the failure and rewrites the prompt. * Loop: The process repeats until the score reaches 95/100 or the loop limit is hit.SETUP STEPS 1. Configure OpenAI: Ensure you have an OpenAI credential set up in the OpenAI Chat Model node. 2. Customize: Open the Define Initial Prompt & Test Data node and set your initial_prompt, test_input, and ground_truth. 3. Run: Execute the workflow and check the Manage Loop & State node output for the optimized prompt.",

  "summary": "Harness advanced AI prompt optimization with automated iteration inspired by DeepMind’s OPRO and Stanford’s DSPy research.\n\nTransform prompt engineering into a data-driven process where an LLM analyzes score history and logically refines prompts.\n\nEasily separate workflow logic from prompt parameters, enabling self-correction until results meet ground truth expectations.\n\nQuick setup: Define your initial prompt and test data, configure OpenAI credentials, and let the system continuously generate, evaluate, and optimize responses.\n\nAchieve up to 95/100 accuracy by “compiling” prompts without manual trial and error—streamlining prompt design for superior results.",
